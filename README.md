<p> In this repository, I'll build a data pipeline to retrieve Spotify Web API data, write it to Azure Blob Storage, configure an Azure Event Grid subscription, and configure a Snowpipe for seamless integration with Snowflake.</p>

<h2>Spotify API Call</h2>
<p> Up on the repo now is the first working draft of the Spotify Web API call, successfully retrieving artist data with a hard coded artist name.</p>
